Project Overview
This project is a simple **Task Management System** built using Python (Tkinter + psutil).
It demonstrates key **Operating System concepts** such as:

✅ Process Management  
✅ CPU Scheduling  
✅ Memory Monitoring  
✅ System Resource Management  
✅ File Handling (Logging System Events)

The application works like a **mini Task Manager**, showing real-time system status.

Operating System Concepts Used:

Process Management ---> Counts and displays active processes using `psutil.pids()` 
CPU Scheduling ---> Shows CPU usage %, proving CPU sharing among processes 
Memory Management ---> Shows RAM usage using `psutil.virtual_memory()` 
Concurrency / Multitasking ---> Multiple tasks and system processes running simultaneously 
Logging & File Handling ---> Logs daily resource status into a text file (`system_log.txt`)

Features:
- Count **Active Processes**
- Display **CPU Usage (%)**
- Display **RAM Usage (%)**
- Refresh button for real-time monitoring
- Log writing for system history

Requirements:
Install required Python package:

```sh
pip install psutil
